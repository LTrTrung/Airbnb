# The Billionaire Characteristics 
### Project Overview
Airbnb, Inc is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, the platform is accessible via website and mobile app. Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. The company was founded in 2008. Airbnb is a shortened version of its original name, AirBedandBreakfast.com.

The median age of a European billionaire's company is approximately 20 years older than that of an American billionaire. Traditional sectors predominantly drive the increase in wealth in Europe, while the financial and technology-related sectors largely contribute to the surge in US wealth. There are indications that economic rents are higher in the United States than in Europe, as evidenced by not only the rapid expansion in the number of US billionaires but also the increasing average wealth among them over time, particularly in areas tied to resources, nontradables, or finance.
